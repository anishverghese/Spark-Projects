# Spark-Projects

This repository contains a collection of Spark projects showcasing various data processing and analysis tasks using Apache Spark.
Each project is organized as a separate zip file, covering different topics such as k-means clustering, tweet data analysis, and common word extraction.

**Projects Included**
1)K-means Clustering: This project demonstrates the implementation of k-means clustering algorithm using Apache Spark. 
It includes the necessary code, data, and instructions to perform clustering on a given dataset and visualize the results.

2)Tweet Data Analysis: The tweet data analysis project focuses on processing and analyzing Twitter data using Apache Spark. 
It includes code snippets and data samples to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and topic modeling on a collection of tweets.

3)Common Words Extraction: This project aims to extract the most common words from a given text dataset using Apache Spark.
It provides code examples and a sample dataset to illustrate the process of tokenization, word count, and identifying the most frequent words.
